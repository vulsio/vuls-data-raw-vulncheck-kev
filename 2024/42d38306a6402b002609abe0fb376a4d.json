	"shortDescription": "The OpenMetadata CompiledRule::validateExpression method evaluates an SpEL expression using an StandardEvaluationContext which  allows the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as java.lang.Runtime and leading to Remote Code Execution. The /api/v1/policies/validation/condition/<expression> endpoint passes user-controlled data CompiledRule::validateExpession allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying operating system. There is also a missing authorization check since Authorizer.authorize() is never called in the affected path and therefore any authenticated non-admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution.",
